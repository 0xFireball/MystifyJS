# MystifyJS
A versatile JavaScript editor with a built-in JavaScript engine and powerful obfuscator.

## OSS Release

MystifyJS was previously an experiment of IridiumIon Software, and was proprietary software. However, as I am no longer developing it, I am releasing it for free under GPLv3.

[Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exaphaser.MystifierLight)

Currently supported platforms:
- Windows (Mystifier Studio, WPF)
- Android (MystifierLight, Xamarin.Android)

Coming soon:
- OS X (Mystifier Studio, Xamarin.Mac)
- Linux (Mystifier Studio, Eto.Forms/GTK#)
- iOS/Android/UWP (MystifierMicro, Xamarin.Forms)

MystifyJS makes your JavaScript development easier and more productive, and protects your intellectual property by obfuscating code with a number of advaned obfuscation techniques.
